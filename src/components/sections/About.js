              My name is Idan Atias, I am 29 years old,<br />
              Born, raised and stays in Israel. <br />
              I enjoy developing websites,<br />
              And the company of good people.<br />
              The intrest in code started 4 years ago. <br />
              Since then the hobby accumulated passion,<br />
